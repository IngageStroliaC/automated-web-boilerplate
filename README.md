# Simple website boilerplate for training

This is a basic website starting point which integrates support for technologies such as Angular, twitter bootstrap,
less, grunt and other commonly used website technologies.

It's primary purpose is show:

1. How to create a boilerplate
2. Some useful tools for web development
3. Why each part of the boilerplate is there and what it is used for

You can, of course, simply copy the resulting boilerplate and use it as a starting point for your own web development

But if you really want to see how to build a boilerplate and see what sorts of things can be done, I encourage you to
look carefully at each step in its creation.

Many comments have been added to the source control to describe each step in detail.

It is hoped that after going through this, you will have a starting point for tailoring your own boilerplate as well as
the knowledge of how and why to do it.
